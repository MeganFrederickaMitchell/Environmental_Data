# Lab Questions {.tabset .tabset-pills}


## Q1 

Submit the code you used to build your ANOVA by hand. Make sure you use the code template so that you use the same variable names as those which Iâ€™ll use for the grading.
    
    rm(list = ls())
    
    require(here)
    
    here()
    
    rope = read.csv(here("rope.csv"))
    
    rope$rope.type = factor(rope$rope.type)
    levels(rope$rope.type)                       

  ## TSS  
  
    n_obs = nrow(rope)
    n_groups = length(levels(rope$rope.type))
    ss_tot = sum((rope$p.cut - mean(rope$p.cut))^2)
    df_tot = n_obs - 1
    ss_tot 

  ## Within group SS
    
    agg_resids = aggregate(
      x = rope$p.cut,
      by = list(rope$rope.type),
      FUN = function(x) (x - mean(x)))
    str(agg_resids)
    
    agg_sq_resids = aggregate(
      x = rope$p.cut,
      by = list(rope$rope.type),
      FUN = function(x) sum((x - mean(x))^2))
    str(agg_sq_resids)
    
    ss_within = sum(agg_sq_resids$x)
   
    df_within = (n_obs - n_groups)
 
  ## Partioning Variance: Among Groups
    
    ss_among = (ss_tot - ss_within)
    df_among = n_groups - 1
    
  ## Normalizing: Mean Squares                      
  
    ms_within = ss_within / (n_obs - n_groups)
    ms_among  = ss_among / (n_groups - 1)

  ## The Test Statistic: F
    
    f_ratio = ms_among/ ms_within
    f_pval = 1 - pf(f_ratio, df_among, df_within, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)   

  
  ## ANOVA in R

    fit_1 = lm(p.cut ~ rope.type, data=rope)
    anova(fit_1)
    
    anova_fit_1 = anova(fit_1)
    str(anova_fit_1)
    str(anova_fit_1$"Sum Sq")
    str(anova_fit_1$`Mean Sq`)

  
  ### Q1 SELF-TEST

  
  # number comparison tolerance

    digits_check = 5

  # Build the reference model using R functions

    fit_1 = lm(p.cut ~ rope.type, data=rope)
    anova(fit_1)
    anova_fit_1 = anova(fit_1)

    # Check degrees of freedom
    anova_fit_1$Df == c(df_among, df_within)

  # Check sums of squares
    round(anova_fit_1$`Sum Sq`, digits = digits_check) == round(c(ss_among, ss_within), digits = digits_check)

  # Check mean squares

    round(anova_fit_1$`Mean Sq`, digits = digits_check) == round(c(ms_among, ms_within), digits = digits_check)

  # Check the F-ratio

    round(anova_fit_1$`F value`[1], digits = digits_check) == round(f_ratio, digits = digits_check)

  # Check the F test statistic p-value

    round(anova_fit_1$`Pr(>F)`[1], digits = digits_check) == round(f_pval, digits = digits_check)

## Q2  

Examine the conditional boxplot in the Partitioning Variance: Within-Group section of the walkthrough. Based on the figure, do you think there are equal variances among the groups?

    Based upon visual inspection of the conditional boxplots, there is not equal variance among group types. This is because the lengths between boxplots differ from one another which suggest more or less variance between groups. For example, the boxplots for the rope types BLAZE, SB, and VEL differ in length from BS, PI, and XTC boxplots.

## Q3  

Conduct a Bartlett test to assess the homogeneity of variances of the percent cut among the rope type groups. Report the p-value.
    
    bartlett.test(p.cut ~ rope.type, data = rope)
    p-value = 0.00143


## Q4  

Given your graphical assessment (question 2) and the Bartlett test, do you think an ANOVA-type analysis is appropriate on the raw data? Explain why or why not.

    One-way ANOVA was probaby not an appropriate test for the raw data because this test assumes equal variance among all comparison groups. Based upon visual inspection of the boxplots, it shows the boxplots differed in length which indicates there is not equal variance among groups. Additionally, the p-value from the Bartlett test was >0.05, suggesting we reject the null hypothesis that variances among groups are the same. In sum, one-way ANOVA may not be suitable because analysis of the raw data showed it violated the assumption of homogeneity of variance. 

## Q5  

Which rope type is the base case?

    The Base case is the BLAZE rope type because this is the intercept.

## Q6  

What is the mean percent cut of the base case rope? Show your calculation using value(s) from the model coefficient table.

    36.714 %
    There are no calculations necessary because BLAZE is the base case (intercept) and everything is relative to the base case.
    0.36714 * 100 = 36.714 %

## Q7  

What is the mean percent cut rope type XTC? Show your calculation using value(s) from the model coefficient table.
   
    26.55 %
    This value was obtained by adding the base case to the XTC rope cut estimate. 
    Base case + XTC rope cut estimate = XTC mean percent rope cut
    0.3614 + -0.10164 = 0.2655 * 100 = 26.55 %
