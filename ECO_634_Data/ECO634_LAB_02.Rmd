1. Show the R code you used to create vec_2. :::{.warn} Your code should be a complete and self-contained example. I should be able to paste your code into a fresh R session on my computer and re-create your v'

  n = 12345
  vec_1 = sample(12, n, replace = TRUE) # you can resuse the numbers, 
  vec_1 = sample(12, n, replace = FALSE) 
  head(vec_1)
  vec_2 <- c(vec_1==3)
  vec_2
  head(vec_2)
  tail(vec_2)

2.Give two reasons why determining which elements in vec_1 have value 3 by visual inspection is a bad idea

* It would be difficult and hard on the eyes to discern this from such a giant data set and could lead to more errors. 

3. Why didnâ€™t you always get the same count of 3 entries each time?

*  Because they are randomly generated integers

4.Considering the different vectors generated each time, explain why using a logical test is a safe way to select entries with a value of 3.

*brackets and dollar signs...

5. Explain why performing logical subsetting is very very bad practice. You may want consider re-usability of code, working with different sized data sets, and sharing code with collaborators.

* logical subsetting is not as useful with large datasets and for sharing codes relative to a function
* 

6. Provide the code for your modified loop. It must run as a self-contained example on a fresh R session on my computer.

for (i in 1:10)
{
print(
  paste0(
    "This is loop iteration: ", i))}    
    
    
7. Provide the code for the modified loop that executes n times. It needs to be a self contained example. I should be able to set the value of n and then run your loop on my computer.

for (n in 1:5)
{
print(
  paste0(
    "This is loop iteration: ", n))}
    

8. Provide the code you used to create the n, vec_1, and the loop. As always, it should run as a stand-alone example in a fresh R session on my computer.

*   n = 17
    vec_1 = sample(10, n, replace = TRUE)
  length(vec_1)

  for (n in 1:17)
  {
  print (
   paste0(
     "The element of vec_1 at index " , n , " is " , vec_1[n]))
    }

create_and_print_vec = function(n, min, max)
vec_3 = sample(x= min:max, size=n, replace = TRUE)
for (i in 1:n) 
{
print(
  paste(
    "The element of vec at index " , i , "is" , vec_3[i]))
}
  
  
  
   length(create_and_print_vec)
   for (n in 1:20)
  {
  print (
   paste0(
     "The element of create_and_print_vec at index " , n , " is " , n))
    }    

***
for (i in 1:10)
{
  print(i)
}































{
  # Function body goes here
}

#
n = 17
    vec_1 = sample(10, n, replace = TRUE)
  length(vec_1)

  for (n in 1:17)
  {
  print (
   paste0(
     "The element of at index " , n , " is " , ))
    }    




1.
#vec_1 = length(n)

for (n in 1:10)
{
  print(n)
}


vec_1 = for (n in 1:10)
{
  print(paste0("The value of the number is ", n))
}



9. Provide the code you used to build your function.
To receive full credit your code must run without error on a new R session and produce output similar to the examples given in the instructions.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
